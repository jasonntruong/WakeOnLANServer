# WakeOnLAN Server to power on my computer over LAN using my Google Home

Yes, there are other ways to do this without any coding necessary, but that requires giving services your IP and PC MAC address.

It also seemed like it'd be a fun project to do from scratch so I can get my foot through the "PHP door" :D

Currently I'm looking at how to implement encryption and use POST requests rather than GET requests to make the server safer to use

**Uses: PHP, Python, SQL, Apache Server, Raspberry Pi**
